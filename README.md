# k-d-tree
A C++ templated implementation of a k-d tree.

Just a simple example I'm implementing to learn from.

Make sure you have g++ and gdb installed. Or modify tasks.json to whatever compiler and debugger you use. From VS code, run Build Task (Ctrl-Shift-B) to build test.exe, then "./test.exe" to run it.
